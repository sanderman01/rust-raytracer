# rust-raytracer

## A very simple raytracer written in Rust. 

Intended to serve as an educational exercise for myself, to get more familiar with the Rust programming language.
It is loosely based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend)

---

If you want to build and run this program, then I highly recommend you use release mode as running a release build gets you a approximately a factor 100x speedup, compared to a debug build. This could mean the difference between a render taking minutes vs hours.

`cargo run --release`
